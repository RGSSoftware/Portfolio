 My name is Julius Ray Parks. A growing photographer and videographer from the south suburbs of Chicago. I’ve started out doing youtube videos of august 2011 randomly browsing the internet of entertainment & comedy. I’ve always had a thing for cameras such as controlling the camera or being in front of it. Videos was my main talent and then I’ve discovered i had an eye for photography as well. I didn't call myself a photographer just because of one click on the camera and taking shots. I was all about angles, styles, & the art of the picture. Pictures started out working for me better around summertime of 2012 after I knew how to work a camera better. I started out with the canon rebel t3i camera which I still have now until I achieve something better. I think I can get far with what I’m doing and being able to manage both photography & videography.
